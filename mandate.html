          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            The Startup Club (TSC) is a non-profit organization established on
            30th July 2023 and is headquartered in Chennai, India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until September 2024, we had primarily focused on virtual events.
            You can find a history of our events on our
            <a

            channel. Starting in October 2024, we have transitioned to organize
            physical events.
          </p>

          <h2>Organizational Mandate</h2>
          <p>
            Our overarching objective is to establish a functional support
            system for members of the startup ecosystem in India. We wish to
            bring together students, aspiring founders, founders, investors,
            incubators, service providers, and other stakeholders of the
            ecosystem together in a constructive and collaborative ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that India is at the cusp of an entrepreneurial boom and
            our goal is to accelerate the evolution of each entrepreneur and
            aspiring entrepreneur so that they fail faster, gather experiences
            sooner and are better informed so that they leverage resources to
            achieve their first success faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward we will be working to establish micro-hubs across
            India to create physical centers of learning, growth and knowledge
            exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important distinction between us and other local startup clubs in
            colleges or communities is that we're a pan India nonprifit
            organization that works in conjunction with the local clubs within
            colleges. We are not here to compete with them or replace them. We
            are here to assist them in being more effective and help them
            connect with a larger network of clubs across India. So, if you are
            an administrator of a startup club, please get in touch with us and
            we will assist you in integrating your club into the larger
            ecosystem.If you wish to collaborate with us, you can find the
            necessary details to contact us
