          <h2>Organizational Mandate</h2>
          <p>
            Our overarching objective is to establish a functional support
            system for members of the startup ecosystem in India. We wish to
            bring together students, aspiring founders, founders, investors,
            incubators, service providers, and other stakeholders of the
            ecosystem together in a constructive and collaborative ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that India is at the cusp of an entrepreneurial boom and
            our goal is to accelerate the evolution of each entrepreneur and
            aspiring entrepreneur so that they fail faster, gather experiences
            sooner and are better informed so that they leverage resources to
            achieve their first success faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward we will be working to establish micro-hubs across
            India to create physical centers of learning, growth and knowledge
            exchange. If you wish to collaborate with us, you can find the
            necessary details to contact us
